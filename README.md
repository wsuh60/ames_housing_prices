# Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

# Executive Summary
We used a Kaggle dataset to predict what features were best for predicting housing prices. This project made me focus a lot on feature engineering and removing multicollinear features. I also tranformed the dataset using standard scaler and ran models before and after the transformation to compare them. 

The models I have used in this project are lassoCV, random forest, and gradient boost. For each model, I used gridsearch to find the most optimal parameters and these were the results:
